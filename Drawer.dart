     #Drawer 
     widget is used to provide access to different destinations and functionalities provided in your application. 
     It is represented by three horizontal parallel lines on the upper end of the scaffold.  
    It has a horizontal movement from the edge of the Scaffold that navigates the link to different routes in the flutter app.
  
 In order to use the app drawer you need to import the material component package that is ” package: flutter/material.dart.”
 The Navigating AppDrawer is divided into three sections namely header, body, and footer.
 The idea is about having a navigator with a couple of items as the drawer’s child that will be navigated to different destinations on getting tapped.
All children of a Drawer widget are usually in ListView and initially, only the DrawerHeader is present in the UI which when tapped extends horizontally.
